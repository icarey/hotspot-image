        <h1> Battling the Pain Without Opiates:</h1>
        <h2>Patients increasingly turn to acupuncture and cannabis to treat chronic pain</h2>
        <br>
        <h4 id="byline">by Isaac Carey</h4>
        <h4 class="main-text" id="simon">
        <p>Simon Chartrand was 23 years old when he found himself, one morning, unable to eat or speak. Two years ago, an oral surgeon had severed his lingual nerve during a routine wisdom tooth extraction. Since then, he had felt a constant low-level pain in his mouth – but this was different. He began to faint while drinking water.</p>
        <br>
        <p>He was taken to the hospital by his boyfriend, where an IV sustained him for a week through artificial hydration and nutrition. His doctor cycled through various pain medications, trying to find one that would work. Exhausting all other options, he settled on high doses of Dialudid, a strong opioid.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“These are the pain killers you give to, like, terminally ill patients,” Simon says. He is en route to his weekly acupuncture appointment in midtown Manhattan. “By the time I left, I was taking 8 pills at a time. Which is enough to kill a person. But I was already so used to it that I could take it.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Like many people living with chronic pain, Simon decided to try acupuncture out of a feeling of desperation. As the rate of new prescriptions for opioids rise, the rate of overdose rises even faster. According to a recent survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, the number of deaths from prescription opioids has increased by over 18,000 incidents in the past 20 years, and roughly 38% of the population who take opioids report taking them for chronic pain. And doctors, although they know the risks, are in a tough position – opioids treat pain better than anything else on the market.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But many patients are opting out. Simon (pictured below) uses combined physical therapy and acupuncture to manage his pain. It does not give him the same relief – or the euphoria – that Dialudid would, but it allows him to continue working towards his PhD in French Literature, and teaching French classes on the side. He is still catching up on the work he missed while on high doses of opiates.</p>

            <div id="circle_2" class="circle" data-text="While only 1.1% of Americans said they had used acupuncture as a form of pain management in 2011, that number has risen to 3% in 2017, according to a 2017 Statista Survey"></div>

            <div id="circle_3" class="circle" data-text="Right under the jaw is one of the most common places Simon has the needle inserted, along with one on the forearm. New York accupuncturist Viktor Krustefek explains acupuncture relies on the idea that 'there are are many nerve channels throughout the body, all of which are connected.' According to Krustefek, stimulating one point of the body can 'unblock' an entire channel, where nerves may be misfiring, providing pain relief."></div>

                for a minute." - Simon Chartrand, 24</blockquote>

            <p>Like Simon, Jamie W. was hit with a sudden, chronic pain condition at a young age. In 2013, he had just graduated from college when he began to suffer debilitating headaches and nausea, which left him unable to work. He was diagnosed with
                New Persistent Daily Headache, which the American Migraine Association calls “the most treatment refractory of the headache disorders" - in other words, it rarely responds to treatment. According to Jamie, he was given a prescription for
                opiates and told by his doctor to “wait it out.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>Jamie turned to cannabis as a form of relief. First buying it illegally, then obtaining his medical marijuana license in 2016, when New York State legalized the use of medical marijuana. In particular, it treated his nausea, which is typical
                of the headache disorder. As more states legalize the use of cannabis as a prescription drug, more patients seek it out for pain management.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, findings on the effectiveness of long-term cannabis use for pain is mixed, with some studies citing it as a valuable alternative to opioids, while others say it can have harmful long-term cognitive effects.</p>

            <div id="jamie_circle2" class="jamie_circle" data-text="Jamie says the biggest drawback is monetary. 'In New York,' he explains 'You have to pay $250 to $500 to renew your recommendation every few months. And I was already spending almost $400 month just buying the medical marijuana.'"></div>

            <div id="jamie_circle3" class="jamie_circle" data-text="'It helped with my nausea the most,' Jamie says. 'I was at a point where I couldn't eat. And with my mood.

                cheaper. <span class="credit">(Photo: Isaac Carey)</span>
